# IBM-Data-Engineering-Professional: Course 14 Data Engineering Capstone Project
This is to upload my capstone project. I achieved 48/50 by AI grading from Coursera. It has six different parts:
### 1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the problem statement.
   - Objectives of the project.
   - Key questions to address.

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - Description of data sources.
   - Methods used to collect and preprocess the data.
   - Summary of the dataset structure.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Initial insights and patterns observed in the data.
   - Visualizations and descriptive statistics.
   - Identification of any anomalies or trends.

### 4. **Data Preparation**
   - Data cleaning and transformation processes.
   - Feature selection and engineering.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### 5. **Modeling**
   - Selection of machine learning algorithms.
   - Implementation and training of models.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.

### 6. **Big Data Analytics with Spark**
   - Evaluation metrics for model performance.
   - Key findings and insights.
   - Final recommendations and future improvements.
